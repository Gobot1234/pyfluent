    "solver.tui": """The PyFluent solver text user interface (TUI) API is provided to command the
Fluent solver using commands that are Pythonic versions of the TUI commands used
in the Fluent console. Much like Fluent's TUI the API provides a hierarchical
interface to the underlying procedural interface of the program.

See :ref:`ref_user_guide_tui_api` for general guidance on using the TUI APIs.

The TUI based examples in our gallery, such as in :ref:`ref_mixing_elbow_tui_api`, provide a guide for how to use this API.
